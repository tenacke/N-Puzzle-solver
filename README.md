# N-Puzzle-solver
This is how you can run the solver

The process is simple;
In input.txt file, the first line is the dimension of the puzzle (3 for 3x3 puzzle or 8-puzzle, 4 for 4x4 puzzle or 15-puzzle etc.)
you can find the sample inputs in the input directory.
The other lines represent the board. Whitespace for columns and new line for rows... The number 0 is for empty tile.

The output.txt file shows the minimum number of moves and shows the moves accordingly.
